# Module-11-Challenge
## UFO Sightings

### Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to allow users to access a webpage where they can search for information related to UFO sightings. Furthermore, the webpage allows users to search and filter their results based on the following criteria:
- Date
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape

### Performing a Search
Navigate to the webpage. The title 'THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE' will be displayed. A 'Filter Search' is displayed. Populate the desired fields as shown in Fig 1. below and select 'Enter' to return the results:

### Summary:

The most glaring issue with this webpage is that the user is not aware of the limitations of the data set in which they are searching. Specifically, there is only UFO sightings data for the year 2010 and the United States as a country. The interface which allows you to search based on these criteria falsely gives the user the impression that there is more data available to search then there is in actuality.

The webpage would benefit from the following updates:
1) Limit the search fields to the fields that actually have a diverse range of data that can be returned.
2) If search parameters have no other data points that can be substituted, the input should be 'greyed out', thus indicating that this field is not amendable.
